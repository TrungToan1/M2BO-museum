                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>the story begins in 2008 in a garage box in the city of the hague.
                    through 2 friends hansan tsdemr and pascal rappailes.
                    the garage box was soon too small, so they looked for a new place and ended up in a shed.
                    the shed had no heating and everything had to be transferred in the winter.
                    when this location also had to be cleared out. became the collection of 10 arcade cabinets at that time
                    transferred to an old showroom of classic cars. there they could not work on the cabinets due to lack of space.
                    so the search continued for a suitable space. in 2011 they had found a good place.
                    only due to the growth, the hobby approach was no longer appropriate and.
                    they decided to take a professional approach. in 2015 she switched to a company called playworks BV.
                    in 2016 they had the idea to turn it into a museum. At the beginning of 2017, a location was found in collaboration with the municipality.
                    the formal v&d building in the city center of Zoetermeer. on December 1, 2017, the museum was ready for visitors.</p>

                <p>Fantastic place for young and old! It is listed as a museum but then the work is the coolest museum I've ever been to! It's just a huge arcade hall with every conceivable video game console an arcade cabinet from the 70's to now!
                    Great admission price for a few hours of unlimited play on everything it says. They also have a living room from that period for some older consoles! Talking about a flashback!
                    Definitely recommended for young and old if you like gaming!</p>

                    <h5>Leoni Notenboom</h5>
                    <p>What a nice museum. Not just for the youth! Paperback, wolfenstein 3d, prince of persia and photo play also present as many other old games. We have been entertained from 7 years to 72 years old</p>
